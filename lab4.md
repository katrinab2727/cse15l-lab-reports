### Step 1 - Log into ieng6

Keys Pressed: `<up><enter>`
**Command run: `ssh kbosler@ieng6.ucsd.edu`**

I had this command in my command history. It was the most recent command I typed in my local computer's terminal after lab, so only one `<up>` was needed. The command logs me onto the CSE server using ssh for the ieng6 machine.
