## `cd` Command

**No Arguments**
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$
```
The working directory was lecture1 when cd was run. Using cd without an argument sets the working directory to home, so the current directory was changed from lecture1 to home.

**Path to a Directory as an Argument**
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$
```

**Path to a File as an Argument**
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1/messages/en-us.txt
bash: cd: lecture1/messages/en-us.txt: Not a directory
```
